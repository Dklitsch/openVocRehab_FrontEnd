Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) is a federal-state program that helps people who have physical or mental disabilities get or keep a job. 

This is the front end, written in React.js using Material UI.

I hope to help states avoid vendor lock in by providing an open source alternative to current propriatary technologies. openVocRehab is implimented with a GraphQL/Django backend and a React.js front-end. It's also hoped that these newer technologies will lead to a better user experience.
